# dsApproach2ProcessControl
Codes to simulate the theoretical insights in the paper Data Science Approach to Process Control


# Main Codes

1. `sim_var_model_final.R`
   - This code runs the simulation studying the impact of auto-correlation and batching on the optimization of a machine learning model with respect to each unit versus an aggregate.
   - This code relates to section 3 **Optimizing the Aggregate**


2. `sim_manipulated_quality.R`
   - This code runs the simulation of the model of quality measures that accounts for manipulation in measurements
   - This code relates to section 4 of the paper on **Proportions Control Chart**
